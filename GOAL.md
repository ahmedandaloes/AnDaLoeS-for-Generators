## 🚀 TOP PRIORITY: Launch Readiness (owner directive 2026-06-23)
Get the app **ready to use** end-to-end before adding more features. The core
journey must work with no dead ends: sign up → browse → book → owner accept →
active → complete → rate. Readiness audit running; blockers land in the
"Launch blockers" list below as found. Rule for the loop: **fix readiness
blockers before any new feature.** Money model stays parked (owner decides).

### Launch blockers (readiness audit 2026-06-24)
CRITICAL — marketplace couldn't function end-to-end (DB-layer chain). FIXED:
- [x] C1: companies missing `description` → owner onboarding insert failed (DB 0024 added column)
- [x] C2: no admin UPDATE policy on companies → "Approve company" silently rejected by RLS → catalog permanently empty (DB 0024 added companies_update_admin + generators_update_admin)
- [x] C3: was a blocker only if no admin existed — verified an admin profile already exists (not a blocker)
- [x] C4: owner stuck on "Under review" — downstream of C1–C2, now resolved (approval works)
- [x] H4: customer-facing raw `Error: $e` → routed through friendlyDbError (booking, company onboarding, rating)

HIGH — real-user auth. DECISION (owner 2026-06-24): **verified email now, phone later.**
- [x] Launch auth: EmailAuthScreen (/email-auth) — explicit sign-in/sign-up, email
      confirmation messaging (Supabase enforces confirmation at sign-in if enabled),
      friendly auth errors, guest browse. "Continue with email" is now the primary
      button on the login screen.
- [x] H1: `/dev-login` gated behind kDebugMode (works in debug for testing, hidden in release).
- [ ] Verify Supabase project setting: "Confirm email" should be ON for production
      (so unconfirmed accounts can't sign in). Owner to confirm in Supabase dashboard.
- [ ] Phase 2: phone OTP once owner provisions an SMS provider (Twilio/Vonage) — UI built; keep it.
- [x] H3: guest→registered upgrade — premium CTA on profile for guests opens a
      sheet that links email+password to the same anonymous user (updateUser), so
      favorites/rentals/chats carry over. Email confirmation applies if enabled.

MEDIUM (polish):
- [x] Delivery address/time now structured columns (DB 0025) — captured on request,
      shown to customer at confirm + to owner on the request card (ops can fulfill).
- [ ] Digital payment is "coming soon" stub (COD works) — tied to monetization decision
- [ ] company_documents table unused; verify RLS airtight (hardcoded publishable key)
- [x] company onboarding now saves governorate (was only city); location join deduped

## FOCUS: Validated Business Thesis (market research 2026-06-23)
Full strategy in `docs/BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md` + money model in `docs/MONETIZATION.md`.

**Thesis:** A trust-based booking marketplace for **B2B/SMB generator rental**
(events, construction, factories, telecom, agriculture) — NOT consumer
outage-backup (Egypt ended load-shedding in 2024–25; that demand is fading).
**Win on the whitespace no incumbent fills:** published day-rates + one-tap
verified booking + a trust layer. Money model: shift the flat 50 EGP fee → a
**percentage commission via digital escrow**, phased 8–10% → 12–15% as trust
features ship. Seed supply in **Cairo + Alexandria** first.

### Target rental workflow (money path)
browse → instant booking (calendar) → security DEPOSIT held → owner ACCEPTS →
escrow collects rent+deposit → ACTIVE → COMPLETED → commission auto-deducted,
owner paid out ≤3 working days → deposit released/claimed → both RATE.
(Commission & payments stay server-side via DB triggers, never the client.)

### NEXT (this loop) — buildable in-app now, no external dependency
- [x] **Money model: percentage commission.** commission_config switched fixed
      50 EGP → 10% (DB 0022, verified live); owner request card now shows
      projected net payout ("You receive EGP X · 10% platform fee") via
      commissionConfigProvider + projectCommission helper. Customer still sees
      the full total (commission is owner-charged).
- [x] **Security deposit field** — owner sets a refundable deposit; shown at booking; stored on rental_requests (DB 0027)
- [x] **Use-case/segment tags** on generators (DB 0023 use_cases text[] + GIN
      index). Owner picks them in add/edit (chips), customer filters by them in
      the browse filter sheet, shown on the detail screen. Shared
      kGeneratorUseCases constant. Operationalizes the B2B repositioning.
- [x] Revenue: admin Revenue tab — editable commission rate, accrued-vs-settled totals, per-commission "Mark collected" (ledger model; DB 0026 admin RLS). Cash-market revenue tracking now; online auto-collect (Fawry) later.
- [ ] Status state machine: guard invalid transitions at DB level (e.g. no rejected→active)
- [x] Double-booking: enforce no overlapping accepted/active rentals per generator (DB 0021)

### ⏳ DECISION PENDING — revenue collection model (owner to choose later)
A % commission isn't collectable on cash-on-delivery (money never flows through
the platform). Four options recorded in `docs/MONETIZATION.md §1b`:
(A) owner subscription + featured, (B) Fawry/escrow % commission, (C) owner
commission ledger / post-paid, (D) hybrid (subscription now, % later). Until
chosen: the 10% rate (DB 0022) and the owner request-card "platform fee" label
are **provisional** — accrued `commissions` rows are the accounting backbone but
nothing actually collects cash commission yet. Re-word the owner label once decided.

### SOON — needs external integration / compliance / decision
- [ ] **Digital escrow payments** (Paymob or Kashier): collect rent to platform
      account, auto-deduct commission, mass-payout owner ≤3 days. → release-ci + security-architect
- [ ] **Fawry pay-against-code** for the COD segment (capture "cash" into the platform)
- [ ] **Damage protection / basic insurance** (justifies raising take rate to 12–15%)
- [ ] **Anti-leakage**: off-platform-dealing detection (cancellation/contact-share patterns) + penalties
- [ ] **CBE payment-facilitator compliance review** (escrow account, EGP settlement, June-2025 PSP rules) before holding rent at scale
- [ ] Generator approval gate: new generators default to `pending` (PRODUCT DECISION — needs active moderation; enum already supports it)
- [ ] Referral credits (growth lever; coordinate with monetization-expert) + deep linking to listings (WhatsApp-native sharing)

### UI/UX POLISH (ongoing — clean, Uber-grade)
- [ ] Price transparency on cards/detail (day-rate always visible — our differentiator)
- [ ] Rental request: date range conflict chip UX improvements
- [ ] Accessibility audit (semantic labels, contrast ratios)

### DONE-WHEN
- [~] Test coverage: real unit tests for core business logic (commission, db_error, ICS, sizes, use-cases) — 11 tests passing. More to follow toward 80%.
- [ ] Web support (currently passkeys SDK error)
- [ ] macOS desktop support
- [ ] Accessibility audit (semantic labels, contrast ratios)

## 🏆 Market-Readiness Roadmap (business experts 2026-06-24)
Story + market-challenge analysis in `docs/PRODUCT_STORY.md`. Synthesized from
product-strategy + marketplace-growth + monetization experts. Theme tags; effort
in (). Build NOW items in-app; SOON/LATER need integrations/decisions/advice.

### Fulfillment & Trust (on-time + confidence — the core promise)
- [~] [NOW] Owner SLA: pending requests show "requested Xh ago" urgency chip (green<1h→amber<4h→red) nudging fast accept. Auto-expire (needs cron/edge fn) → SOON.
- [ ] [NOW] Delivery confirmation — owner "out for delivery" → customer "received" (opt. photo) → ACTIVE, timestamped
- [x] [NOW] Security deposit field (generator + rental_request, DB 0027) — owner sets it, shown to customer at booking, stored on the request
- [ ] [NOW] Verified-owner badge from company-approval state on cards/detail (wire the unused company_documents)
- [ ] [SOON] Fulfillment status timeline on the ticket (accepted→preparing→en route→delivered→active→returned)
- [x] [NOW] Owner reliability — shared companyReliabilityProvider (acceptance, response, on-time, completed). On-time % badge added to generator detail; company profile migrated to the shared provider (removed duplicate).
- [ ] [SOON] Two-sided dispute/claim flow (extend reports: damage/no-show/wrong-spec + evidence + admin adjudication)
- [~] [NOW] Cancellation policy shown at booking ("free while pending; coordinate with owner after accept"). Penalties/strikes → SOON.
- [ ] [LATER] Backup-fulfillment fallback — suggest nearest equivalent when an accepted owner cancels late

### Growth (supply, demand, liquidity)
- [ ] [NOW] Public web listing pages (no-auth, SEO/Arabic URLs) per generator/company — organic discovery
- [ ] [NOW] WhatsApp deep-link sharing with rich preview (photo+kVA+rate+city), app/web fallback
- [x] [NOW] Supply-by-governorate tracker in Admin Stats (available generators per area, "thin" flag <3) — via GeneratorRepository.countAvailableByGovernorate (repository, no inline dup)
- [ ] [SOON] Owner quick-add / bulk listing flow (migrate OLX/Facebook owners with low friction)
- [ ] [SOON] Saved searches + "new match" alerts (reuse notifications + use_cases)
- [ ] [SOON] Two-sided referral invites with deep links (attribution; credit value = monetization)
- [ ] [SOON] First-booking nudge sequence (browse→request drop-off, segment-aware copy)
- [ ] [LATER] Seasonal summer-demand campaign hooks; repeat/re-book loop for telecom/agri; listing-quality score

### Monetization (revenue path forward)
- [x] [NOW] Owner balance: Owner Earnings shows "Platform fees owed (all time)" — cumulative unsettled commission to settle (accrued vs settled from commissions). Makes the cash ledger real for owners.
- [ ] [NOW] Owner subscription + featured-listing fees — leakage-proof, collectable without a gateway (Med; needs a digital charge endpoint)
- [ ] [NOW] Unpaid-balance listing-suspension rule (anti-churn for the cash ledger)
- [ ] [SOON] Fawry pay-against-code — turn cash into platform-collected funds so % auto-deducts (High; owner = payout recipient)
- [ ] [SOON] Paymob/Kashier escrow — collect rent, auto-deduct, mass-payout ≤3 days (High; owner merchant acct)
- [ ] [SOON] Anti-leakage detection + penalty tiers; tiered/per-company rates (commission_config already supports override)
- [ ] [LATER] Damage protection/insurance add-on (justifies 12–15% take); CBE payment-facilitator compliance review (gates escrow)

### Tax & Compliance (Egypt — like Uber; get professional advice first)
- [x] [NOW] Tax Invoice: VAT (14%) breakdown (subtotal excl. VAT + VAT line, treating totals as VAT-inclusive) + company tax-reg# / CR in footer (core/config/company_info.dart — set real values before production)
- [x] [NOW] Sequential immutable invoice numbers (DB 0028: invoice_seq + invoice_no stamped on completion via BEFORE trigger; invoice shows INV-001001…)
- [ ] [NOW] Accounting export from Revenue tab (date-range CSV: commissions, payments, VAT collected)
- [ ] [SOON] Owner payout statements (for owner income reporting; WHT if required)
- [x] [NOW] Commission + VAT accounting export from Revenue tab (CSV)
- [x] [NOW] Configurable customer tax (tax_config: rate/label/when; admin-editable) — owner sets dad's real % (e.g. 2% on invoice). Confirm with accountant.
- [ ] [SOON] Owner payout statements (for owner income reporting; WHT if required)
- [ ] [LATER] ETA e-invoicing integration (needs tax registration + ETA onboarding); confirm corporate tax/WHT with an Egyptian accountant

### Owner directives (2026-06-24) — to schedule
- [x] [NOW] Role separation audit (RLS): rental_requests (customer cancel-only, owner via owns_company, admin), generators (owner/admin only), messages (rental parties only) — all solid. FIXED gap: ratings could be inserted by anyone → now restricted to a party of a COMPLETED rental + unique per rater/rental (DB 0030).
- [~] [SOON→started] Admin Ops dashboard (7th tab): overdue active rentals, stale pending (>24h), accepted-not-started — via new RentalRepository (repository layer). More ops views to follow.
- [x] [NOW] Calendar access — "Add to calendar" on My Rentals exports an .ics (any calendar app, no native permission/package). Reminders via calendar app.
- [ ] [SOON] Notification access — device push notifications (FCM + flutter_local_notifications) with permission request; currently only in-app realtime. Needs native config (android/ios gitignored) + FCM setup.

## 🎨 Page Improvement Plan (product-owner + UX experts, 2026-06-24)
Per-page review of the live code. Implement NOW items in the auto-loop on `development`.

### Cross-cutting [NOW] — highest leverage (clear many items at once)
- [ ] Shared `AppErrorState` widget (friendly message + Retry; no raw `$e`) — replaces bare `Text('$e')` on detail, rental request, my_rentals, offer/invoice/receipt, all owner-dashboard tabs, owner earnings, notifications, chat (~10 screens).
- [ ] Tokenize status/trust colors — recurring hardcoded `Colors.green/orange/red/amber/grey.shadeXXX` (detail badges, rental statuses, owner stats/gradients, favorites pill, document scaffolds) drift off the blue/green system + break dark mode. Centralize status→color + positive/verified→cs.secondary/tertiary.
- [ ] ≥48dp tap-target pass — home sort/favorites/login pills, detail small FABs, owner request-card buttons, dashboard Earnings button (32px), _MonthChip, my_rentals report/receipt/calendar controls.
- [ ] Chat: move `_scrollToBottom()` out of build → addPostFrameCallback keyed on message count (correctness; respects no-work-in-build rule).

### Business wins [NOW] (product owner)
- [ ] Detail: guest can pick dates/address first; require auth only at "Send request" (recovers the biggest browse→request drop-off).
- [ ] Owner request card: delivery-confirmation step ("Out for delivery" → customer "Received") instead of accepted→active in one tap — the core on-time fulfillment gap; feeds reliability badges real data.
- [ ] Payment confirmation: itemized total (rate × days + deposit line + grand total) + sticky bottom total/CTA bar.
- [ ] Detail: hoist a compact verified + on-time/acceptance trust row above the fold (unify the 3 inconsistent badge styles).
- [ ] My Rentals: read structured delivery_address (stop regex-parsing the note); show deposit status; friendly error.
- [ ] Owner request card: echo deposit "collect EGP X on delivery" reminder; owner dashboard acceptance/on-time chips.
- [ ] Home: persist filters/sort across sessions (shared_preferences); friendly states.

### [SOON]
- [ ] Detail: move share/copy/report into AppBar so Rent Now dominates. Add cancellation/terms acknowledgement at payment.
- [ ] My Rentals: reduce 7 stacked buttons to one primary + overflow; show cancellation reason on cancelled cards.
- [ ] Company profile: show review text + documents-verified indicator. Add Generator: clone listing + local draft.
- [ ] Login: friendly auth errors + resend-code. Notifications: list skeleton + stronger unread signal.
- [ ] Document screens (invoice/receipt/offer): theme the scaffold/greens (dark-mode), friendly errors, format ISO dates.
- [ ] Home: min-kVA filter + fuel/verified on card; saved-search alerts (favorites + use_cases + notifications).

## Loop State (updated each iteration)
**Last iteration:** 2026-06-23
**Working branch:** `development` (main is integration/release)
**Mode:** continuous loop (owner directive — no timer waits; finish item → start next).
**Last commit:** `fix: company onboarding governorate + dedupe location`
**iOS local constraint:** ios/ is gitignored. After fresh checkout: set IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=16.0 in Podfile + xcodeproj, run pod install
**Next action:** money-model shift — switch commission_config to ~10% percentage + show fee/payout breakdown at request time (rental-workflow + supabase-db). See docs/BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md + docs/MONETIZATION.md.
**Strategy:** repositioned to B2B/SMB trust marketplace per market research 2026-06-23 (docs/BUSINESS_STRATEGY.md).

---

## How the Loop Works
Pattern: **Continuous-PR loop + De-Sloppify + Verification gate** (see the
autonomous-loops skill). GOAL.md is the cross-iteration context bridge
(`SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` role). Each loop:
1. Read GOAL.md → pick top unchecked item(s) from NEXT
2. (non-trivial) Delegate via the Agent tool — investigate/build in PARALLEL
   through the project agent team; reviewer ≠ author
3. Implement → **de-sloppify** (remove dead code, over-defensive checks, raw
   error leaks) → `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` (zero errors AND warnings)
4. Verify (qa-gatekeeper): tests/build + live-DB check for any migration
5. Commit (conventional) → push to `development`
6. Move items NEXT → Shipped ✅; replenish NEXT from SOON
7. Update "Loop State"
8. `ScheduleWakeup(600s)` to continue — UNLESS an exit condition is met

### Exit conditions (don't loop forever — anti-pattern #1)
- **Completion:** NEXT is empty AND nothing remains to replenish from SOON →
  stop scheduling, report done.
- **Blocked:** a step needs a human decision (product call, secret, external
  access) → stop and ask rather than spin.
- **Safety bound:** if the same item fails its gate 3 iterations running →
  stop, capture the failure context in Loop State, ask for input.

### Quality gates (a change is NOT done until all pass)
- `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos`: zero errors, zero warnings.
- Any DB change: numbered migration, applied + verified against the live DB
  (constraint/enum/trigger inspected; no new errors in logs).
- Money/notification logic stays server-side (DB triggers), never client.
- Feature-first structure honored (feature-structure-guardian).

### CI gate (risky changes)
For schema/auth/money changes, prefer a PR into `main` and wait for the
`flutter.yml` checks before merge, instead of pushing straight through.
